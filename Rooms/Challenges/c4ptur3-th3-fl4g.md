## Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

If we have a `.wav` file hiding a message, install `sox` package and run:
```
sox secretaudio.wav -n spectrogram
```
It generates a `spectrogram.png` file we can open and see the hidden message.

We can also use online tools for this purpose: https://www.dcode.fr/spectral-analysis (uncheck Logarithmic Scale option)

## Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

```
steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg
Enter passphrase:

wrote extracted data to "steganopayload2248.txt".

cat steganopayload2248.txt
```

## Security Through Obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

```
binwalk -e meme.jpg
```
and you will get a file called `hackerchat.png`. Run `strings hackerchat.png` for getting the last answer.
